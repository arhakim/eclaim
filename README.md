# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-minimum-32-characters"

# File Upload Configuration
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880  # 5MB in bytes

# Application Configuration
APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
COMPANY_NAME="Your Company Name"

# Scheduler Configuration (Optional)
SCHEDULER_TIMEZONE="Asia/Jakarta"  # Default timezone for notifications
```

### Database Setup
eClaim uses PostgreSQL as the primary database. Ensure you have:
- PostgreSQL server running and accessible
- A database created for the application
- Proper user permissions for database operations

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd eclaim
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure to install the dependencies using pnpm (recommended):

```bash
pnpm install
```

Or using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update the environment variables in `.env` with your configuration:
   - Set your PostgreSQL database connection string
   - Generate a secure JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
   - Configure file upload settings and company information

### 4. Database Migration
Run Prisma migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
pnpm prisma generate

# Run database migrations
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

### 5. Database Seeding
Populate the database with initial data including sample departments, users, and test claims:

```bash
# Run the database seeder
pnpm prisma db seed
```

The seeder will create:
- **Sample Departments**: HR, Finance, Marketing, Sales, Engineering, Operations, Legal
- **Admin User**: admin@company.com (password: admin123)
- **Manager Users**: Various department managers
- **Employee Users**: Regular employees under different managers
- **Sample Claims**: Test expense claims in different statuses

### 6. File Upload Directory
Ensure the uploads directory exists and has proper permissions:

```bash
# Create uploads directory
mkdir -p public/uploads/receipts

# Set permissions (Linux/macOS)
chmod 755 public/uploads/receipts
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

### Development Server
Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Default Login Credentials
After seeding, you can login with these accounts:

**Admin Account:**
- Email: `admin@company.com`
- Password: `admin123`

### Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## ‚è∞ Running the Scheduler

The eClaim system includes an automated scheduler for sending reminder notifications to managers about pending approvals.

### Automatic Scheduler
The scheduler is automatically initialized when the server starts and runs:
- **Daily at 7:00 AM** (configurable timezone)
- Checks for claims in `IN_REVIEW` status
- Groups claims by manager
- Sends notification reminders to managers
- Includes claim count, total amounts, and urgency indicators

### Manual Scheduler Trigger
For testing purposes, you can manually trigger the scheduler:

#### Via API Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/trigger-reminders
```

#### Via Dashboard (Admin only)
- Login as an admin user
- Go to the Dashboard
- Click "Trigger Reminders" button in the admin section

### Scheduler Configuration
Configure the scheduler in your `.env` file:

```env
# Set the timezone for scheduled notifications
SCHEDULER_TIMEZONE="Asia/Jakarta"  # Default: Asia/Jakarta
```

### Creating Test Data for Scheduler
To test the scheduler functionality, run the test data creation script:

```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/create-test-data.ts
```

This creates:
- A manager and employee relationship
- Several expense claims in `IN_REVIEW` status
- Perfect for testing the reminder notifications

### Scheduler Logs
The scheduler provides detailed logging:
- Startup confirmation with timezone
- Daily execution logs with timestamp
- Manager notification details
- Error handling and reporting

Monitor scheduler activity in your application logs when running in production.
